1. Required code statements:
 - `include "uvm_macros.svh" -> contains all the uvm macro files
 - import uvm_pkg::*; -> used to import all the uvm base classes that can be extended to build the testbench
 - using uvm_info instead of display automatically shows the reporter(based on the ID)
 - it also shows simulation time 
 - ex: UVM_INFO /home/runner/testbench.sv(8) @ 50: reporter [TB_TOP] This is a message to test UVM_INFO
 
2. When extending any class, constructor method (new()) is always required to connect the class to UVM

3. To change verbosity globally add in the run options (via cmd line) +UVM_VERBOSITY=UVM_HIGH(set depend on required config)

4. UVM_ACTION values are bitwise, can use multiple actions for a severity
 - for example: drv.set_report_severity_action(UVM_INFO, UVM_DISPLAY | UVM_EXIT);
 
5. max_quit_count = upper threshold, quit_count = ends simulation when reached
 - max_quit_count = 5, quit_count = 10 -> simulation finishes after 5 errors
 - quit_count = 5, max_quit_count = 10 -> simulation still finishes after 5 errors
 - if same test is ran again, and it produces more errors than before max_quit_count protects regression run
 - note that both counts applies to total count of info, warning, error, and fatal (if count action is applied)
 - by default, only UVM_ERROR has count action
