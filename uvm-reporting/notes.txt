1. Required code statements:
 - `include "uvm_macros.svh" -> contains all the uvm macro files
 - import uvm_pkg::*; -> used to import all the uvm base classes that can be extended to build the testbench
 - using uvm_info instead of display automatically shows the reporter(based on the ID)
 - it also shows simulation time 
 - ex: UVM_INFO /home/runner/testbench.sv(8) @ 50: reporter [TB_TOP] This is a message to test UVM_INFO
 
2. When extending any class, constructor method (new()) is always required to connect the class to UVM

3. To change verbosity globally add in the run options (via cmd line) +UVM_VERBOSITY=UVM_HIGH(set depend on required config)
