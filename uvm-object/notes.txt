UVM_OBJECT
1. Static objects -> components that remain the same throughout the simulation
   - example: driver, monitor, sequencer, scoreboard
   -> created using UVM components
   Dynamic objects -> components that change throughout simulation, only alive after task has been completed
   - example: transactions (data)
   - created using UVM objects (extending this class(uvm sequence item))
   - uvm object is derived from uvm component class
2. uvm_objects
   - uvm_transaction
   - uvm_sequence_item
   - uvm_sequence
3. uvm_components 
   - uvm_driver
   - uvm_sequencer
   - uvm_monitor
   - uvm_agent
   - uvm_scoreboard
   - uvm_env
   - uvm_test
4. Core methods -> field macros that provide automation for transaction classes: 
   - print, record, copy, compare, create, clone, pack + unpack
5. Core methods -> User defined methods are called do_* methods
   - do_print, do_record, do_copy, do_compare, do_pack, do_unpack
   - do_* methods can be modified to be more in-line with own implementation
   - field macros are not as flexible as do_* methods
6. `uvm_object_utils -> registers uvm object
7. `uvm_field_* macros -> registering data fields
8. It is up to your implementation but there are multiple ways to print for example
   - Use automation methods by registering fields using field macros (print)
   - Use do_* methods for more flexibility (do_print)
   - Or go fully manual by using $display method
